Grimo Nut Nursery - www.grimonut.com

Ernie and Linda have been breeding hazelnuts for over 45 years and offers many good cultivars, from their own selections and those of Oregon State, as well as 7 interesting seedling hazelnuts, hardy northern varieties and tree hazels. 

They offer a guide with details about the varieties they offer and planting advice here - https://www.grimonut.com/shared/media/editor/file/Hazelnut%20Trees%20for%20Zones%204-8%202019.pdf

I placed a large order with them in 2021 and all of the plants arrived healthy and grew very well.

They have gathered and tested varieties from the other University hazelnut programs (Rutgers, Nebraska, and Oregon State), as well as private breeders. 

Lots of resources on the website and recorded presentations on YouTube by Jason Fischbach from UW-Extension.
